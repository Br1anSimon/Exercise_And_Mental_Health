                <p>Resistance training sparks an “endorphin rush” similar to a runner’s high. Elevates mood-regulating neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine).</p>

            <h2>Built to Last</h2>
            <p>Weight lifting offers measurable progress that motivates consistency. Small wins—like lifting more or refining form—build long-term engagement. For those managing chronic anxiety and depression, the stability of routine fosters emotional durability and relapse prevention.</p>

        <h2>A Long-Term Ally</h2>
        <p>
            Some professionals worry that emphasizing weight lifting distracts from psychological therapies. But this creates a false divide—mental and physical health are deeply linked. As research by Blumenthal et al. (2007) demonstrates, integrating exercise with traditional treatments produces better results than either alone. Resistance training should be viewed as part of a holistic toolkit, not a replacement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The long-term impact is especially compelling. Studies like Martinsen (2008) show that regular lifters are less likely to relapse into depressive episodes. Discipline, bodily autonomy, and routine offer protective structure and build resilience. Weight lifting isn't just treatment—it's prevention.

        <h2>Mind and Muscle, Together</h2>
        <p>
            Weight lifting isn't a cure-all—it's a complement. Combined with therapy or medication, it creates a powerful, whole-person approach to healing. Resistance training addresses body and mind, offering tools for both recovery and resilience.
